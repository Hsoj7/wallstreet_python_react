I removed a bunch of CLOV yolos because everyone is complaining about it, if you're one of those people who had your YOLO removed just post a Gain update when there's a significant move.

Ya guys came on too strong with your discord vote brigade tactics, people don't like that shit. You can like the stock without being sneaky. We're not removing good non-duplicative DD or anything, just this onslaught of posts out of nowhere.
I’m just a simple man trying to turn 15K into 100K although currently I’m at 1K. So to all you highrollers risking 500K and posting gains of 20% fuck you.
One good trade boys.  Just one good trade.  And I’m out for good.

Just read an article saying SPY is likely to crash this week.

May test August lows.

August lows,  the fucking August lows.

Oh no we've lost 7 days of gains the great depression is upon us
A good Labor Day at 23yrs old: Spend all day on the boat with friends, then pick up an 8ball in the afternoon and rage downtown till the bars close, then call up your bipolar gf (who totally wont try to burn your building down in a couple months) to come suck your dick. 

A good Labor Day at 33yrs old: Go to your mom’s house for a burger and to play with her puppy golden retriever, then go back to your apartment and get just drunk enough to clean your kitchen and take the trash out before passing out while watching The Wire for the 8th time.

I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the monies. "Where's the money? "When are you going to get the money?" "Why aren't you getting the money now?" And so on. 

So please, the money.

New strategy. Every time SPY 0 dtes print, half of profit gets saved for future 0 dtes and the other half TSLA LEAPs
I have 80% of my portfolio in BABA calls and the other 20% on SPY puts. The best part? My SPY puts are 50% down already and should be 70% down at open meaning my BABA gains will perfectly offset them. This has happened for the last two weeks. 

My retardation and genius is perfectly balanced: As all things should be.
My mom loved me so much she gave me extra chromosomes

Can't make a wife outta a hoe.
Y'all ever heard of the [80/20 rule?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) 80% of the gains come from 20% of the stocks (in this sub's context). Michael K. Williams was the 20 when it comes to the Wire, which is widely considered to be the best show of all time. He was the favorite to win an Emmy in two weeks. Enormous loss.

Did you guys know that last week they finally stopped selling leaded gasoline? In the US lead gas sales stopped in the 90s. But overseas they still used it. We finally stopped shooting lead particles out of cars. Lead poisoning can lead to mild retardation and aggression. The boomers up until last week lived in a world full of leaded gas. Hmmm

It’s not the tapering that matters. It’s if the Fed funds rate get’s raised. That is what will physically hurt the market.... but let’s be real, it’s beyond reasonable to have a Fed funds rate finally above %0 at this point in the economy. 

Therefore raising rates won’t hurt the bull market, get rekt Burry and Bears.

So going out and feeding those stray dogs today was a really good feeling, I actually felt pretty fulfilled and got endorphins from a healthy outlet. I think this motivated me to start a rescue one day and do this all the time.. my dreams of getting rich on the market was driven by debaucherous intentions of hookers and expensive possessions but now I feel like this would be what I’d do with it. Hopefully market Jesus sees this and makes me rich so I can help animals. Sorry for getting a soft on u guys
Wow look at all the big tech charts. All of the refusing to budge from ATH, literally no fucks given.

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in the current economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy all the time, it always follows the profits.

My friend a classic car collector was bragging to me for an hour about how much his classic cars appreciated during COVID. 

I showed him that if he just put money spent on maintenance and those cars in SPY he would have made at least 3x the money while doing nothing. 

He was pissed.
Tomorrow I’ll be reflecting on the fact that today was my Reddit birthday and I didn’t know it until now. So I have 90 minutes to celebrate. I’ll also be reflecting on why this seems to matter.

all these meme stock tards with a vaneer of "believing" in the stock. just cut the bullshit, you want to make money like everyone here and you're hoping that your shit stock can make you rich. goddamn pathetic watching the shilling and pandering. take the losses like the gambling degenerates you are and learn from it. the market divorced from fundamentals long time ago. stop sticking to one stock and learn to quickly enter a rally and exit with a profit. 

these juiced rallies are fucking yoked and just few fds can really change your financial future. or you can just hold that shitty bag with your dick in your hand while other shit pops. this isn't a goddamn sports game

Backstory: last week i went to cash my check at the bank and theres this teller there who always has an additude and asks me dum questions. With a smug look on his face i show him my check and his eyes blow wide open, then my check flies outta my hands and sticks to his upper lip. He startes panicking and finally gets it off when all of the sudden every drawer opens up and checks start flying everywhere and he attempts to catch them all like harry potter. Depite the nonsense, still bullish on wells fargo.

You can do it man. The process of getting there will suck, but it'll be worth it in the long run. Also the weight loss will help with your ugliness.
Fitness is a long road for everyone.  A lifetime to be exact.  Track your progress and make sure you keep making small, measurable, and achievable goals.  Also, try to moderate the frequency/intensity.  It's easy to burn yourself out even when you're making significant progress.  Focus on building habits and routines that you can sustain over a long period of time.  

If you want to get there, you'll make it.  No question.  Staying there is the challenge that conquers most of us.  Good luck and congrats on making a life altering decision.
You go, brother! Give it a 4 months and you are fit af

I feel like maybe it’s for the best. Talented people don’t need to really go around telling people how talented they are. They let their work speak for itself. So maybe I should just let my shitposting speak for itself also

2 quarters ago their PE was like around 1000. In one quarter, it went down to about 700. Now it's like 400. Considering they have enough cash on hand to pay off their debt but won't cause debt is cheap, it should be closer to about 200.   


Good luck with that short
Tesla went from 1200 pe earlier in the year to a quarter of that, at this rate itll be the next Wareen Buffet’s value play

Revenue is recognized in country of origin. Go look at Facebook for a fun use case. They recognize a shit ton of rev thru Ireland to dodge taxes. Everyone does this but Facebook is blatant
Not usually, they usually funnel the money into the lower taxed country. In this case it would be a 3rd country, Ireland, which is a tax haven and where almost all international firms hide their money.
Looks good but correction is very near

I don't remember how much, but I remember going to a Buffalo strip club and not having any cash. So I went to the ATM to get money and there was nobody really around me. I got out cash and when I turned around there were 3 strippers standing there like hyenas. This one buxom beauty covered in black lace took my hand and then proceeded to do all the grinds and the behinds moves. My cash was gone in like a minute.
