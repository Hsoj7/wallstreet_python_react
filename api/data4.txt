‚ÄúGonna short robinhood ipo‚Äù - some guy with a 4 figure account literally using Robinhood with no actual ability to short and the inability to tell the difference between a put and a short
it's crazy that you can basically turn into a millionaire any day if you buy the right option...
Nikola is The most America Thing possible .

Become a multi billion dollar public company by rolling a fake truck down a hill for a promo video
Robinhood just emailed me saying they couldn‚Äôt have done it without me. This is all my fault guys.

1st day HOOD bagholders already lol
Put in a limit order for 7 shares of HOOD at 39 cents.  Maybe the 39 will trick them. When you have less than 3 dollars of buying power you gotta think differently.
I was born a poor black child in the swamps of Bulgaria.
I see all the people talking about calls and puts on HOOD. The absolute state of this sub. You fuck ups know you can‚Äôt trade options on IPOs right??

Robinhood app open, bags are heavy, allocated shares at a loss already

Vlad‚Äôs spaghetti
ADVANCED MONEY DISPENSER
So how many of us are gambling in the stock market to compensate for the fact that nothing else in our miserable existence brings us even a little bit of joy and gives us something, anything to look forward to and losing money is better than having nothing to do or being alone with our own thoughts.. or just me haha
If Cathie gets into HOOD, I‚Äôm exiting ARKK.

I judge my coworker for buying $5 scratch offs yet I regularly throw hundreds or thousands at shit I don't research in hopes it goes green.

They don't call it the S&P 500 for nothing

SPY $500 EOY
Buy CLF you cocksuckers
Just buy calls on Spy dips retards
I lost like 40k last year when I had to cover my NKLA short after the vaporware truck preorder was announced. The stock doubled along with the borrow fee jumped to like 1000% annualized so it was impossible to hold the short no matter how obviously fraudulent it was. I hope he ends up broke and in prison, but of course that won't happen.
To the retard that needs to hear this.  There will not be options immediately on HOOD.

Robinhood CEO be like: "I am glad you have directed your attention to me and decided to ask me a question of which you had to go through a mental process to come up with such question, and so, id like to thank you for taking the time to come up with the question. So let me start by making sure that you realize how greatful i am that you ask me a question. So before i answer your question i would like to tell you tale of the little boy that once was in Bulgaria..."
HOOD fucked some of you guys again
Honestly surprised Robinhood hasn't deactivated selling
The very stock you are using to buy stocks is being bankrupt
WE DONT LIKE HOOD. WE DONT LIKE THE STOCK.
If Robin hood drops too much they might restrict selling.  Only buying
Daily reminder: ipo stands for it‚Äôs probably overpriced

Gonna be a bunch of HOOD bagholders screaming it's about to squeeze for the next two weeks I bet
Statistically, I should win big at least as often as I blow up my entire account, right? Same odds of a big move in either direction, with a slight bias in favor of bullishness.

Yet I only ever seem to lose. I am a mathematical improbability.

Here I was preparing for a red day. I should have known, ber is always fuk
Things I‚Äôve done well with options: 1. Buying SPY calls on red days and selling on green days. 2. Buying long calls on companies with likely catalysts. 3. Buying FDs on meme stocks if I get in early. Things I‚Äôve done poorly at: 1. Buying puts on anything. 2. Playing earnings even when IV is not historically high. 3. Bottom fishing on stocks I haven‚Äôt followed for a while.
I‚Äôll take a little gamble on HOOD, put a bid in and try to sell before the end of the day
WISH ain‚Äôt stopping today!

Nothing tanks a stock like good earnings
Not a HOOD proponent, but I feel like just because public retail sentiment for HOOD is not-as-positive, the market is going to fuck retail and moon this bitch.
Thanks Robinhood for the early access to losing money LOL
Robinhood gonna have to halt its own stock.

HOOD fucked over retail and sec gave not one shit. Most of retail doesn't care either.
Just sold my house and got my equity out. What do I yolo this on?
*Cathie Wood wakes up in a hospital*

Ma'am, you went into a coma from buying too many $HOOD shares. We've been keeping you on a 30% QQQ and 70% SPY IV for the past few days.
442c for tomorrow eh 40 of them ?
5 hours ago I said:

‚ÄúFun fact: If $SPY breaks and can hold above 441 there is NO RESISTANCE until 446
Play accordingly :)‚Äù

And that bounce off of 440.99 like 1 minute ago tells me all I need to know. AKA BULLISH AF
**Buy your SPY $442 FDs now**

HOOD gonna BOOM at open, shitadel and Melvin capita have to return the favor (that‚Äôs how favors work)

so glad i bought CLF at 19
Apple you whore go back to $150
most of you talking about how you're going to short HOOD are probably the same retards who still use it
Done being a SPY bear, can't fight the sheer retardation
You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have accidentally made gains by now
HOOD gonna rob your ass. Better come strapped fool

Cathie about to buy a shit ton of HOOD
HOOD bringing the meme stocks down with it LMAO
mofos insiders bought at 12, now, trying to unload this onto the unsuspecting retards at 30 plus. Fuck $HOOD. Don't buy this piece of shit stock. Fuck Vlad. Fuck Silicon Valley smugs.
Being a HOOD bear feels bullish
Just woke up from a year long coma. How are my $NKLA 100C leaps doing now? They must be ITM by this point, right?
$VLAD would have been danker

Last week I sold my calls, SPY went up.  This week I held my calls, SPY takes a big afternoon shit, and now I‚Äôm red again.
I‚Äôll be honest folks, I will probably lose a good amount of money tomorrow
False alarm. I‚Äôm not a DIDI millionaire. GUH
If someone holds NOK just wait a little bit. I just sold it and that means it will have huge gains in one or two days. This happens with every stock i sell :)
Ok F. I‚Äôm gonna need you at 17$ by tomorrow. That should be a decent return on my 14$ strike

Anyone want to guess how much capital the ‚Äúshorting Hood‚Äù crowd actually has? Or if they actually know what shorting it means?

I see a lot of similarities to GMEtards.
The fact that NKLA still ticks up is evidence of how fake this market is. Who the fuck is buying it?
I have a hunch that HOOD ipo has potential for the 3rd resurgence of meme stocks
Can one more tard please ask when Hood opens! WTF ?
I‚Äôm no monster, but I would absolutely sacrifice one of you to the blood gods if it meant SPY hit 443 today

If your limit order to buy hood isn't at a penny you aren't living your best life
HOOD down 11%, Gourd is great ü§™
Hood.... Literally everyone saw this coming
Just bought one share of HOOD to make it easier to follow on my broker's shit UI. $34 is cheap for this kind of entertainment.
Bitch Face Vlad
Looks like Vlad disabled the sell button.  They have some green candles now
SPY doing that thing where it grows consistently upward over the years.
Can't wait for options to come out on HOOD the loss porn will be glorious
HOOD P&D at IPO is very fitting
Asked someone who didn‚Äôt know stocks if they thought Amazon was going up or down.   They said up.  Therefore. We are bullish
guy literally named after dracula, company stock must be red
Gotta love how much porn the SEC watched as the market went to shit.

Who‚Äôs mom do I have to fuck to have TSLA close above $700?
Do we load up on spy calls for tomorrow now?
My wild guess is that AMZN actually moons tomorrow and the previous earnings sell offs were the big boys conditioning us to expect it to sell off like all other big tech did.
start with 50k, run a theta gang strategy selling puts 1 stddev OTM for a 0.8% weekly return

    50000 * 1.008^x = 1000000
    1.008^x = 20
    log_1.008 20 = x = ln(20) / ln(1.008) = 375.96 ~= 376
    
    376 / 52 = 7.23

you can be a millionaire in 7.23 years if you sell puts in an IRA starting with 50k ü§°
Dear Diary,
Today I put my worth into SPY. Please don‚Äôt let it fuck me around too much. Love WIZARD
Absolutely cannot wait untill I see HOOD on Cathy‚Äôs trades tonight.
You have been permanently banned from participating in r/NikolaCorporation.

Yes!!!
[deleted]
I need the last 15 minutes for spy to rip and dildo like no other so I can get out of these calls
Something in my gut tells me AMZN going to fly up after earnings. This will result in SPY going up. This results in NASDAQ going up.

This results in a green Friday tommorrow.

Lets hope my thinking is the right mind set or just plain out retarded
Surprising amount of emotional traders here

Call your mom and tell her you love her
Invest in security stocks right before close, it will be night time soon and people will need security guards
Yung Lean was ahead of his time
Remember that time spy went up 1% in 2 minutes at close a few months ago. That was wild
FB rebound and AMZN beat gonna help lift SPY to 445 tomorrow
SPY support at 441, red candles keep getting wicked out, pretty confident in holding these 442c thru 2nite ... til i wake up and get fucked by EOM dump
Okay SPY you can commence your power 2 minutes now
SPY such a fizzling slut

One time my cousin and I touched weiners
TLRY pew pew üöÄ
I still will never understand why people on this sub pick sides and exclusively invest in the market like it‚Äôs a sports team to support. Bull vs Bear, American or Chinese stocks, ect. Who cares, be pragmatic and make money where you can, and a lot of you lose money because you invest with personal feelings instead of investing for opportunity

NIKOLA  CEO fucked up

r/NikolaCorporation in shambles
I know it‚Äôs trendy to hate on short sellers these days, but you gotta give Hindenburg some serious credit here. Milton might have actually gotten away with that billion dollars if it weren‚Äôt for them.

Holy shit! First time for a while that I've successfully sold at open, waited for the initial drop, longed again, and watched it bounced back to open. Probably will lose everything later, but still, feels like I'm freaking Neo!

SPY so flat I think it gave me my first hand job back in high school.
IRS: we found a error on your taxes. if you don't call us, well assume you agree with that. If you do call us, we won't pick up the phone. have a nice day!
Idk why I dont ever go all in CLF calls. Consistently most profitable trade yet not my largest investment
Amd to 105 by end of day, finally!

Bears win maybe 5 times a month and think they are hot shit
It's not gay if your cousins
This bullshit never happened until GME - now the apes think it‚Äôs a sport and talk shit about people placing money elsewhere. It‚Äôs pathetic and ruined this sub.
you know that they say, inverse wsb
How do u still have money left
Lol I sure did
I bet most here would say the exact opposite
it marked itself as highly volatile and you can‚Äôt buy with margin lmao
I completely agree. There was a time when this sub would have great DD, and although people still played risky, everybody made positions based on making money and not supporting a ‚Äúside‚Äù based on personal feeling.
