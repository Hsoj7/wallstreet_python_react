2) ‚Äúmain coin‚Äù is on the rise currently , COIN usually correlates with ‚Äúmain coin‚Äù
3) The price is 20% below IPO price - so there is plenty room for a rise
4) EV/ revenue =8 if we take into account only existing shares ( and around 20 if we take the number of shares on fully diluted basis)
5) The company is the leader in the market and it‚Äôs revenue is rising by 100% per year
