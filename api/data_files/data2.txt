Recession back on boys, this feels too similar to 1929. Trust me I was there
I have come to the realization that i simply suck at options trading and will only buy bluechip tech shares from now on
In case any of you are too dense to realize it yet, let me spell it out for you:

# Getting rich is no longer an aspiration, it is now a survival strategy.

CPI is .1 if you don't count the things that people actually buy
Ah, SPY 448, a familiar feeling, I remember it like it was yesterday
I can already see the letter from the IRS next year, "Surely you can't be this retarded."
Silly poors, of course we don't count food, housing or gas prices as part of inflation.  
Now then, since CPI is so low, best I can do is a 0% wage increase

This some latestage capitalism shit going on. If you're a poor you're literally fucked
Jim Cramer is still panic buying toilet paper.
If spy hits 500 by the end of year I will get transitory tattooed across my knuckles
I BLAME THE BRITISH
Bros, I know how to fix this.

Every time I buy calls it goes down. So I'm going to buy puts so it can go back up.

I'll take a loss, but its worth it so bulls can rise again

Apple bulls actually think some nerd talking about how they made the iPhone processor 5% faster for 35 minutes is gonna save the stock market lmao

Some of you idiots really underestimate the power of long term investment.

Not very bullish to see my SPY call history go from

That's optimism in practice, but bearish in reality

Can you tell me what‚Äôs going to be revealed this morning?‚Äù He took the donut out of his mouth, gave me a knowing smile and said: ‚ÄúBer r fuk‚Äù and drove off.
Really hoping people don‚Äôt dump IRNT and let this baby run $100+!!!

Somethings off. CPI of 5.3% and 30-yr treasuries at 1.85% but they are rallying.  Either they truly think inflation is transitory or they think stocks will do worse then -3.45% over the next year. My bet is they think stocks are heading for a correction.

All the doom and gloom here probably means that I should be buying calls
This is institutional money dumping there bags slowly on to retail.  Problem is retail eventually runs out of money to "buy the dip" when they do the jig is really up and thats when we will see a real correction to a more sustainable valuatiion level.

someone tell SPY that AAPL is sinking
Why do companies still hold these dumbass events when they literally have nothing groundbreaking to show.  Especially AAPL.  Only people buying anything from them already own their products.  I'm sure their shareholders are thrilled about these events.
Honestly what‚Äôs the next big technological advancement?

Phones have peaked what else can they do?

Autonomous cars are already here.. 

VR hasn‚Äôt caught like everyone thought..

Dear Tim Cook:

Unless you are launching a revolutionary product, just send out an email and a press release to announce the new iphone next time. Thanks
Alright guys I‚Äôll do it. I‚Äôll pick up some puts here. Then the market will immediately rebound to ATH.
I always thought banks made money. 

Then I bought SOFI stock.

This market you got to be in and out like 5 minutes kind of like busting a nut

The August CPI report ‚Äúmight be a little bit of a headfake, honestly,‚Äù said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives, suggesting that the recent inflation surge is proving to be transitory, as economists have predicted.

Uncle JPow told you so, why do you bet against the guy who controls the money printer?
Tim AAPL please carry this market today
Jesus, just realised that I haven't had sex with my wife in months
Lol CPI says houses are up 2.8 percent y/y. They must be counting the projects
I'm convinced that the CPI basket is based solely on the price of Arizona Tea.
Inflation numbers came out right after I checked out at the grocery store.  Confirmation that the Fed is straight up lying to us, and this market is nothing but a circus.  

SPY to $1000 EOW
Who are these people still drinking Folger's and Maxwell coffee?

Bears in shambles?
US Aug Consumer Prices +0.3%; Consensus +0.4%  
US Aug CPI Ex-Food & Energy +0.1%; Consensus +0.3%  
US Aug Consumer Prices Increase 5.3% From Year Earlier; Core CPI Up 4% Over Year
Cpi month over month lower than expected at 0.3% vs 0.4% expected
Inflation truly is transitory
ALL IN FULL MAX MARGIN
Bears never learn
Singapore has a giant panda cub. Even this is bullish

IRNT FDs on sale. I know this because I'm down 50%
Market is now realizing that 5% inflation is not bullish üòÇ
Optimism without reason is delusion.

Puts on SPY.
Come on IRNT, do something, move a bit
Guys, the Fed members announced they are selling their stock. Is there really any other information you need?
A rug pull a day keeps my profits away!

Hello, my name is Ornamental Gourds, and I‚Äôm a recovering Permabull.
I think the feds faked the inflation being too low and now the market doesn't believe the number.
The bulls were out in full force, they got castrated.

I really got in on SPY and QQQ at the worst possible time this morning
The entire market is waiting for the new iPhone
Buying SPY calls now.
Apple announces their own commission free trading app. SPY and AAPL skyrocket‚Ä¶

What would they name it though? iTrade, iLosemoney, iDegen‚Ä¶.
Well I'm positioned for an upward move
I think I hit peak retardation.

&#x200B;

Thought S&P might hit the 50-day moving average this week with a higher than anticipated CPI.  So I thought I bought $443P for 9/17.  Ends up I bought 9/15.

&#x200B;

My butthole puckered up at the open staring at a 60% loss.

&#x200B;

Not certain that I'm going to make it out of this one unscathed.

We at Apple strive for the best. That's why we have created the most powerful iPhone yet. We have it in glossy green now.
lost so much money that I can‚Äôt even feel feelings
AAPL puts or calls before the event?
This is impossible without day trades it‚Äôs just flat
My AAPL plan, buy couple shares before the apple event then buy some more shares after the event when prices drop then buy couple shares like clockwork every week/month after that.

.....motherfucker you just described dollar cost averaging!!!

Anynody actually use smartwatches? Seems redundant when your phone is in your pocket.

Damn! Sam sanchez , you can get it girl
Idk why, but these workout videos make me cringe hard af. Like when I‚Äôm working out i rather be solo and just grind. I dont want some rando screaming ‚ÄúHARDER DADDY HARDER DADDY!‚Äù At me constantly. Takes away from the whole mindset of working out.

AAPL puts printing!

If you've traded AAPL through events you would know that it's ALWAYS sell the news.
Back to ATH by Thursday
tim apple smashing that buyback button to stem the bleeding
Bulls coulda sold at SPY 453 but they're greedy fucks
AAPL is a great company but the chances are small of significant growth in the business enough to justify a major rise from here in the stock price.

With AAPL you are sort of betting on overall inflows to the market.  It's kind of a mildly leveraged index fund right now.
Stop the fight SPY you know apple did just announce Pilates right?!?!?!
if tqqq goes under 140 eow im beign margin called
ok I bought SPY calls. Prepare the strap-on

Damn RIP Norm. Great comic
I think it was a bad idea to sell puts on that support dot com company
it‚Äôs alright SPY, I hate money anyways
We either close green or drill no in between
IRNT is allergic to $21.50
Calls at EOD is a no brainer. Sell at open and buy puts. Rinse and repeat
Analysts: price target raised from 60-70!

just keep irnt above 20 for all that juicy OI on the 20c weeklies
imagine not buying spy calls today after 7 red days ü§°ü§°ü§°
What people don't realize is bears are just bulls who broke the line.
What did you all do!? I leave for one day
Bought SPY calls! Good luck everybody!
Doubled down on all my calls in honor of norm
I buy my SPY calls based on how many bear comments I see in this thread. More bear spam = more calls and tends to work out okay.
I wonder if they‚Äôll ever study in psychology how an online gambling forum spawned a cult of donkey-brained basement-dwellers obsessed with a brick and mortar video game store
JPOW SAVE ME IM FIGHTING FOR MY FUCKING LIFE OUT HERE
IRNT is happening!!
Seriously what the fuck is going on? How can anyone say that the market isn't a complete farce? What are people buying? With what money? No one is producing anything, there are shortages in nearly every sector, there is a labor shortage further hurting supply side issues, prices for everything have skyrocketed over the last two years, and the fed printed 30% of all money ever printed over the last couple years.

And the fed just says everything is fine? Are you kidding me? Who are they fooling? Just waiting for their buddies to sell their positions for "ethics" reasons at the end of the month? This shit is insane. It's literally insane. 5.3% inflation YOY and what was it last year? Nearly the same. Absolutely insane. Real wages are not increasing at that rate, they never have. People have no money to keep up with this batshit insanity and there is goddamn nothing to buy anyway! How is this ok?

Anyway calls on SPY.
26K in SPX puts - Wish me luck. Thanks
I don't know about you guys but I wish covid never happened
I used to mention my stock market losses in vague terms to my family, and typically the response was, well you can always just hold it till it goes back up.

I never told them the second part, about how I had spent all my money that morning on things that would by design expire worthless that afternoon.
You see red

I see opportunity 

^opportunity for me to work at McDonalds
There‚Äôs no inflation McDonald‚Äôs still has $3 bundle
